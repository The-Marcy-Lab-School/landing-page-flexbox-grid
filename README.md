# Unit 1 Lesson 6 Lab: Flexbox / Grid üèÅ
## Landing Page Recreation

### Purpose
During the first week of class, you completed your first lab at the Marcy Lab School. You recreated a "landing page" using the basic markup, styling, and layout tools you learned. Well that was an eternity ago and you have since added a **lot** of HTML and CSS tools to your toolkit. You are revisiting (a different version of) that landing page mockup and you are going to use **CSS Grid and Flexbox** to recreate it!

This lab will illustrate for you, just how powerful layout tools are and how much more simply they allow you to write CSS!

### Directions
You are to recreate [this mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/EGG0ERL0HRRWkXLx4hl4uH/Landing-Page-Lab-Grid?node-id=1%3A3&scaling=scale-down). You **must** use either **Flexbox or Grid ** in this assignment! This is not expected to be pixel perfect. The layout should be **identical**. You should copy the styling as closely as possible, but you can customize the content and the colors. The key features of this layout must include a header, two columns, and a footer at the bottom of the page. As the page size grows and shrinks, the header, two columns, and footer should grow and shrink with it.

**Again, you are not allowed to use any `display` properties other than `grid` or `flex`.** üí™üèΩ
